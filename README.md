<h6> Problem statement : </h6>
<p> Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. </p>
This is not a trivial task since interpreting clinical evidence is very challenging even for human specialists. Therefore, modeling the clinical evidence (text) will be critical for the success of your approach.

Both, training and test, data sets are provided via two different files. One (training/test_variants) provides the information about the genetic mutations, whereas the other (training/test_text) provides the clinical evidence (text) that our human experts used to classify the genetic mutations. Both are linked via the ID field.

Therefore the genetic mutation (row) with ID=15 in the file training_variants, was classified using the clinical evidence (text) from the row with ID=15 in the file training_text
